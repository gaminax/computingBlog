# Initial Post

The issue is figuring out how to organize this website.

The Github Jekyll website generator is limited to Github Flavored Markdown;
but I prefer to use AsciiDoc or Rimu for formatting.

The command line Asciidoc generates a self contained HTML file, which can be uploaded to github, instead of the asciidoc source file.

The AsciiDoctor/Jekyll-AsciiDoc-Quick-Start project shows how to generate asciidoc content via another website, https://travis-ci.org/.
